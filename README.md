# Dever Generator
This project is a personal project to create tasks in Todoist based on my school subject homeworks.

# Notes
- The code is full based on my days, school subjects and IDs of Todoist. But you can change because I used JSON.
- The code probabily isn't the better because I'm still learning.
- That's not a end-user focused project, so bugs can be explored.
- It's in portuguese.
- The design is based for my phone screen, I hate CSS sizing!

# Plans
- Remake CSS sizing, using grid display.
- Make code better and more integraded to JSON files and Todoist IDs.
- Teach how to "upload" your JSON files and apply changes.

# How it works?
Basically, you enter some text about your homework (eg.: Math Chapter 1) and the code will detect the label ID for the subject in Todoist and the next class (due date in Todoist, but it's one day before). After, a request will be made to Todoist server to create the task.
